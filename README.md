# What is in this repository
This repository contains a mirror of my contributions from the University of Twenteâ€™s GitLab platform, where I worked on various technical computer science projects. These projects range across several key domains including "Object-oriented programming", "Logic programming", "Operation Systems and Computer architecture", "Network Development" and more.


# Why This Mirror Exists 
The projects were originally developed in a university GitLab repository. By mirroring these contributions to my personal GitHub, I aim to showcase my development journey, problem-solving skills, and the technical knowledge gained while pursuing my degree in Technical Computer Science. This repository provides an open window into my academic projects and showcases how I contributed to complex, real-world problems in computer systems, networks, and security.
